            <h2>What Cloaked Commerce Does</h2>
            <p>
                Cloaked Commerce lets two pairs of people trade items secretly, without knowing each other’s names.
                For example, if you (person X) have a bicycle (P) and want a book (E), but the person who wants your bicycle (person A) doesn’t have a book,
                we connect their partner (person B) who has the book with your partner (person Y) who needs it.
                This way, you trade your bicycle with person A, and person B trades the book with your partner Y — all while keeping everyone’s identity private.

            <h2>How Cloaked Commerce Works</h2>
            <p>
                You (person X) sign up and post anonymously that you have a bicycle (P) to trade for a book (E), and say your partner Y will receive the book.
                Person A signs up and posts they need a bicycle and can offer a book through their partner B. When we find this match,
                we create a 16-digit hash code as a secret key. We send the first 8 digits to person A and the last 8 digits to your partner Y.
                You (X) send the bicycle to us with the full 16-digit hash code. Then, person A gives their 8 digits to their partner B, who sends the book to us with those 8 digits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we have both the bicycle and the book, we ask your partner Y to send us their 8 digits of the hash code.
                We combine person A’s 8 digits and Y’s 8 digits to check if it matches the full 16-digit hash code.
                If it does, we send the bicycle to person A and the book to your partner Y.
                To keep it fair, we use a list that says how much a bicycle and book are worth—for example, if sending the bicycle costs a little,
                we make sure the book’s value covers it. This way, everyone gets a fair trade, stays private, and the exchange is safe.
