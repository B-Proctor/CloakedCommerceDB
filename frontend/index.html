        <h3>What Cloaked Commerce Does</h3>
        <p>
            Cloaked Commerce lets two pairs of people trade items secretly, without knowing each other’s names. For example, if you (person X) have a bicycle (P) and want a book (E), but the person who wants your bicycle (person A) doesn’t have a book, we connect their partner (person B) who has the book with your partner (person Y) who needs it. This way, you trade your bicycle with person A, and person B trades the book with your partner Y, all while keeping everyone’s identity private.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How Cloaked Commerce Works</h3>
        <p>
            You (person X) sign up and post anonymously that you have a bicycle (P) to trade for a book (E), and say your partner Y will receive the book. Person A signs up and posts they need a bicycle and can offer a book through their partner B. When we find this match, we create a 16-digit hash code as a secret key. We send the first 8 digits to person A and the last 8 digits to your partner Y. You (X) send the bicycle to us with the full 16-digit hash code. Then, person A gives their 8 digits to their partner B, who sends the book to us with those 8 digits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we have both the bicycle and the book, we ask your partner Y to send us their 8 digits of the hash code. We combine person A’s 8 digits and Y’s 8 digits to check if it matches the full 16-digit hash code. If it does, we send the bicycle to person A and the book to your partner Y. To keep it fair, we use a list that says how much a bicycle and book are worth—for example, if sending the bicycle costs a little, we make sure the book’s value covers it. This way, everyone gets a fair trade, stays private, and the exchange is safe. Sign up to start trading!
